# Copilot vs ChatGPT

Both GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are popular AI tools, but they are designed for different workflows.

## Quick overview

- **GitHub Copilot** works best inside code editors and helps with real-time code suggestions.
- **ChatGPT** is more flexible for explaining concepts, generating ideas, writing, and problem-solving.

## When Copilot makes more sense
- Writing repetitive or boilerplate code
- Staying inside the IDE without context switching
- Getting inline suggestions while coding

## When ChatGPT feels more useful
- Understanding logic step by step
- Debugging and explaining errors
- Writing documentation or content

## Final thoughts
Instead of choosing one over the other, many people end up using both, depending on the task.
